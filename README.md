## OBJECTIVES: 
* Describe RDDs and fundamental storage units in Spark computing environment
* Create RDDs from Python collections
* Set number of partitions for parallelizing RDDs
* Review an RDD's dependancy graph at different stages of processing. 

### Introduction

Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) are fundamental data structures of Spark. RDDs can be thought of as immutable distributed collections of data objects. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions, which may be computed on different nodes of the cluster.

In Spark, we first create a base RDD and then apply one or more transformations to that base RDD. Remember that an RDD is immutable, **so once an RDD is created, it cannot be changed**. As a result, **each transformation on an RDD creates a new RDD**. Finally, we can apply one or more **actions** to the RDDs. Spark uses lazy evaluation, so transformations are not actually executed until an action occurs. Let's see this behaviour through a simple example.

In this example, we shall perform several actions and transformations on RDDs in order to obrain a better understanding of Spark processing. 

### Create a python collection 

We shall first create a Python list `data` of integers between 1 and 1000. Use the `range()` function to create this list of a length = 1000 (1 - 1000 inclusive).  


```python
# Create a list (data) as data = [1,2,3..,1000]

data = None

# Use print (data[0], data[999]) to confirm the contents

# (1, 1000)
```

### Create RDD from Python collections

In the spark computation, datasets are treated as list of entries. Such lists are split into a number of different logical partitions that may be stored on different cores. Each split partition holds a unique subset of original list. Such datasets in Spark are called RDDs and are used to split, transform and combine the data during processing. 

Unlike Hadoop which uses physical disks to process data and store intermediate results, Spark performs in-memory processing which allows high speed processing, that can be performed at a much lower computational cost. Following figure shows an overview of Spark processing model .

### `SparkContext.parallelize()` for creating RDDs

In order to create RDDs in Spark, `sc.parallelize()` method is used. This tells spark to create a new RDD based on the data that is passed in. A second argument tells Spark to set a number of paritions for this data as shown in the figure above. 

Use this method to create an RDD (call it `intRDD`) with 5 partitions for the list of integers in `data`, calculated earlier. Remember to intialize a SparkContext first. 


```python
# Import spark and initiate a local SparkContext (execute only once)


```


```python
# Create an RDD with list created earlier, splitting it into 5 partitions
intRDD = None
```

Remember due to lazy evaluation used by Spark, no Spark computation (a.k.a a Spark job) is performed at this state. We can see more options for creating new RDDs by studying built in help on `sc.parallelize()`.


```python
# Get help on .parallelize() method
```

`glom()` allows treating a partition as a multidimensional array rather as single row at time allowing to speed up some operations with some increased memory usage. More information on `glom()` can be found [here](http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/glom-in-spark/). We shall also see how `collect()` action works later in this lab. 

There are many different types of RDDs in Spark. The base class for RDDs is `pyspark.RDD` and other RDDs subclass `pyspark.RDD`. Since the other RDD types inherit from pyspark.RDD they have the same APIs and are functionally identical. Initializing `sc.parallelize()` with a list generates a `pyspark.rdd.PipelinedRDD`. Let's check the type of our RDD to confirm this.  


```python
# Check the type of RDD created earlier, i.e. intRDD


# pyspark.rdd.PipelinedRDD
```

### RDD `id` and `setName()`
Each RDD created this way has a unique ID which is used by the Spark system to refer to the RDD. this can be viewed by using `RDD.id()` function. Let's check the id of RDD we have just created. 

*Note that this value may be different depending upon the sequence of RDD creation and code execution.*


```python
# Each RDD gets a unique ID, check the id using .id() function


# intRDD id: 1
```

Spark also allows naming of RDDs after they've been created using the `setname()` method. Let's use this method to set the name of our RDD as "My First RDD""


```python
# We can name each newly created RDD using the setName() method


# My first RDD PythonRDD[3] at RDD at PythonRDD.scala:49
```

### RDD Lineage
RDD Lineage (aka RDD operator graph or RDD dependency graph) is a graph of all the parent RDDs of a RDD. It is built as a result of applying transformations to the RDD and creates a logical execution plan. We can view the lineage (set of transformations) using the `RDD.toDebugString()` method. 

Let's check the lineage of our RDD using this method. 


```python
# Get RDD Dependancy Graph


# b'(4) PythonRDD[2] at RDD at PythonRDD.scala:49 []\n |  
# ParallelCollectionRDD[1] at parallelize at PythonRDD.scala:184 []'
```

You are encouraged to call this property at different stages of data processing to view the dependancy between RDDs.

In order to check the methods and transformations that can be applied to RDDs, we can simply use the `help()` function.


```python
help(intRDD)
```

     |  
     |  getNumPartitions(self)
     |      Returns the number of partitions in RDD

     |  id(self)

     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Methods inherited from RDD:
     |  
     |  __add__(self, other)
     |      Return the union of this RDD and another one.
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 1, 2, 3])
     |      >>> (rdd + rdd).collect()

     |  
     |  __getnewargs__(self)
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Return repr(self).
     |  
     |  aggregate(self, zeroValue, seqOp, combOp)
     |      Aggregate the elements of each partition, and then the results for all
     |      the partitions, using a given combine functions and a neutral "zero
     |      value."
     |      
     |      The functions C{op(t1, t2)} is allowed to modify C{t1} and return it
     |      as its result value to avoid object allocation; however, it should not
     |      modify C{t2}.
     |      
     |      The first function (seqOp) can return a different result type, U, than
     |      the type of this RDD. Thus, we need one operation for merging a T into
     |      an U and one operation for merging two U
     |      
     |      >>> seqOp = (lambda x, y: (x[0] + y, x[1] + 1))
     |      >>> combOp = (lambda x, y: (x[0] + y[0], x[1] + y[1]))
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4]).aggregate((0, 0), seqOp, combOp)
     |      (10, 4)
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([]).aggregate((0, 0), seqOp, combOp)
     |      (0, 0)
     |  
     |  aggregateByKey(self, zeroValue, seqFunc, combFunc, numPartitions=None, partitionFunc=<function portable_hash at 0x7ff918446c80>)
     |      Aggregate the values of each key, using given combine functions and a neutral
     |      "zero value". This function can return a different result type, U, than the type
     |      of the values in this RDD, V. Thus, we need one operation for merging a V into
     |      a U and one operation for merging two U's, The former operation is used for merging
     |      values within a partition, and the latter is used for merging values between
     |      partitions. To avoid memory allocation, both of these functions are
     |      allowed to modify and return their first argument instead of creating a new U.
     |  
     |  cache(self)
     |      Persist this RDD with the default storage level (C{MEMORY_ONLY}).
     |  
     |  cartesian(self, other)
     |      Return the Cartesian product of this RDD and another one, that is, the
     |      RDD of all pairs of elements C{(a, b)} where C{a} is in C{self} and
     |      C{b} is in C{other}.
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2])
     |      >>> sorted(rdd.cartesian(rdd).collect())
     |      [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]
     |  
     |  checkpoint(self)
     |      Mark this RDD for checkpointing. It will be saved to a file inside the
     |      checkpoint directory set with L{SparkContext.setCheckpointDir()} and
     |      all references to its parent RDDs will be removed. This function must
     |      be called before any job has been executed on this RDD. It is strongly
     |      recommended that this RDD is persisted in memory, otherwise saving it
     |      on a file will require recomputation.
     |  
     |  coalesce(self, numPartitions, shuffle=False)
     |      Return a new RDD that is reduced into `numPartitions` partitions.
     |      
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3).glom().collect()
     |      [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3).coalesce(1).glom().collect()
     |      [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
     |  
     |  cogroup(self, other, numPartitions=None)
     |      For each key k in C{self} or C{other}, return a resulting RDD that
     |      contains a tuple with the list of values for that key in C{self} as
     |      well as C{other}.
     |      
     |      >>> x = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 4)])
     |      >>> y = sc.parallelize([("a", 2)])
     |      >>> [(x, tuple(map(list, y))) for x, y in sorted(list(x.cogroup(y).collect()))]
     |      [('a', ([1], [2])), ('b', ([4], []))]
     |  
     |  collect(self)
     |      Return a list that contains all of the elements in this RDD.
     |      
     |      .. note:: This method should only be used if the resulting array is expected
     |          to be small, as all the data is loaded into the driver's memory.
     |  
     |  collectAsMap(self)
     |      Return the key-value pairs in this RDD to the master as a dictionary.
     |      
     |      .. note:: this method should only be used if the resulting data is expected
     |          to be small, as all the data is loaded into the driver's memory.
     |      
     |      >>> m = sc.parallelize([(1, 2), (3, 4)]).collectAsMap()
     |      >>> m[1]
     |      2
     |      >>> m[3]
     |      4
     |  
     |  combineByKey(self, createCombiner, mergeValue, mergeCombiners, numPartitions=None, partitionFunc=<function portable_hash at 0x7ff918446c80>)
     |      Generic function to combine the elements for each key using a custom
     |      set of aggregation functions.
     |      
     |      Turns an RDD[(K, V)] into a result of type RDD[(K, C)], for a "combined
     |      type" C.
     |      
     |      Users provide three functions:
     |      
     |          - C{createCombiner}, which turns a V into a C (e.g., creates
     |            a one-element list)
     |          - C{mergeValue}, to merge a V into a C (e.g., adds it to the end of
     |            a list)
     |          - C{mergeCombiners}, to combine two C's into a single one (e.g., merges
     |            the lists)
     |      
     |      To avoid memory allocation, both mergeValue and mergeCombiners are allowed to
     |      modify and return their first argument instead of creating a new C.
     |      
     |      In addition, users can control the partitioning of the output RDD.
     |      
     |      .. note:: V and C can be different -- for example, one might group an RDD of type
     |          (Int, Int) into an RDD of type (Int, List[Int]).
     |      
     |      >>> x = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 1), ("a", 2)])
     |      >>> def to_list(a):
     |      ...     return [a]
     |      ...

     |      [('a', [1, 2]), ('b', [1])]
     |  
     |  count(self)
     |      Return the number of elements in this RDD.

     |  
     |  countApprox(self, timeout, confidence=0.95)
     |      .. note:: Experimental
     |      
     |      Approximate version of count() that returns a potentially incomplete
     |      result within a timeout, even if not all tasks have finished.
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize(range(1000), 10)
     |      >>> rdd.countApprox(1000, 1.0)
     |      1000

     |      
     |      The algorithm used is based on streamlib's implementation of

     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 1), ("a", 1)])

     |      [('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
     |  
     |  countByValue(self)
     |      Return the count of each unique value in this RDD as a dictionary of

     |      
     |      >>> sorted(sc.parallelize([1, 2, 1, 2, 2], 2).countByValue().items())

     |  
     |  distinct(self, numPartitions=None)
     |      Return a new RDD containing the distinct elements in this RDD.
     |

     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

     |  
     |  flatMap(self, f, preservesPartitioning=False)
     |      Return a new RDD by first applying a function to all elements of this
     |      RDD, and then flattening the results.
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([2, 3, 4])
     |      >>> sorted(rdd.flatMap(lambda x: range(1, x)).collect())

     |  
     |  flatMapValues(self, f)
     |      Pass each value in the key-value pair RDD through a flatMap function
     |      without changing the keys; this also retains the original RDD's
     |      partitioning.

     |      >>> def f(x): return x

     |  
     |  fold(self, zeroValue, op)
     |      Aggregate the elements of each partition, and then the results for all
     |      the partitions, using a given associative function and a neutral "zero value."
     |      
     |      The function C{op(t1, t2)} is allowed to modify C{t1} and return it
     |      as its result value to avoid object allocation; however, it should not
     |      modify C{t2}.
     |      
     |      This behaves somewhat differently from fold operations implemented
     |      for non-distributed collections in functional languages like Scala.
     |      This fold operation may be applied to partitions individually, and then
     |      fold those results into the final result, rather than apply the fold
     |      to each element sequentially in some defined ordering. For functions
     |      that are not commutative, the result may differ from that of a fold
     |      applied to a non-distributed collection.
     |      
     |      >>> from operator import add
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).fold(0, add)

     |  
     |  foldByKey(self, zeroValue, func, numPartitions=None, partitionFunc=<function portable_hash at 0x7ff918446c80>)
     |      Merge the values for each key using an associative function "func"
     |      and a neutral "zeroValue" which may be added to the result an
     |      arbitrary number of times, and must not change the result
     |      (e.g., 0 for addition, or 1 for multiplication.).
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 1), ("a", 1)])
     |      >>> from operator import add
     |      >>> sorted(rdd.foldByKey(0, add).collect())
     |      [('a', 2), ('b', 1)]
     |  
     |  foreach(self, f)
     |      Applies a function to all elements of this RDD.
     |      
     |      >>> def f(x): print(x)
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).foreach(f)
     |  
     |  foreachPartition(self, f)
     |      Applies a function to each partition of this RDD.
     |

     |      Hash-partitions the resulting RDD with numPartitions partitions.
     |

     |  
     |  histogram(self, buckets)
     |      Compute a histogram using the provided buckets. The buckets
     |      are all open to the right except for the last which is closed.
     |      e.g. [1,10,20,50] means the buckets are [1,10) [10,20) [20,50],
     |      which means 1<=x<10, 10<=x<20, 20<=x<=50. And on the input of 1
     |      and 50 we would have a histogram of 1,0,1.
     |      
     |      If your histogram is evenly spaced (e.g. [0, 10, 20, 30]),
     |      this can be switched from an O(log n) inseration to O(1) per
     |      element (where n is the number of buckets).
     |      
     |      Buckets must be sorted, not contain any duplicates, and have
     |      at least two elements.
     |      
     |      If `buckets` is a number, it will generate buckets which are
     |      evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum of the RDD. For
     |      example, if the min value is 0 and the max is 100, given `buckets`
     |      as 2, the resulting buckets will be [0,50) [50,100]. `buckets` must
     |      be at least 1. An exception is raised if the RDD contains infinity.
     |      If the elements in the RDD do not vary (max == min), a single bucket
     |      will be used.
     |      
     |      The return value is a tuple of buckets and histogram.
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize(range(51))
     |      >>> rdd.histogram(2)
     |      ([0, 25, 50], [25, 26])
     |      >>> rdd.histogram([0, 5, 25, 50])
     |      ([0, 5, 25, 50], [5, 20, 26])
     |      >>> rdd.histogram([0, 15, 30, 45, 60])  # evenly spaced buckets
     |      ([0, 15, 30, 45, 60], [15, 15, 15, 6])
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize(["ab", "ac", "b", "bd", "ef"])
     |      >>> rdd.histogram(("a", "b", "c"))
     |      (('a', 'b', 'c'), [2, 2])
     |  
     |  intersection(self, other)
     |      Return the intersection of this RDD and another one. The output will
     |      not contain any duplicate elements, even if the input RDDs did.
     |      
     |      .. note:: This method performs a shuffle internally.
     |

     |      Returns true if and only if the RDD contains no elements at all.
     |      
     |      .. note:: an RDD may be empty even when it has at least 1 partition.
     |      
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([]).isEmpty()
     |      True
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1]).isEmpty()
     |      False
     |  
     |  isLocallyCheckpointed(self)
     |      Return whether this RDD is marked for local checkpointing.
     |      
     |      Exposed for testing.
     |  
     |  join(self, other, numPartitions=None)
     |      Return an RDD containing all pairs of elements with matching keys in
     |      C{self} and C{other}.
     |      
     |      Each pair of elements will be returned as a (k, (v1, v2)) tuple, where
     |      (k, v1) is in C{self} and (k, v2) is in C{other}.
     |      
     |      Performs a hash join across the cluster.
     |      
     |      >>> x = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 4)])
     |      >>> y = sc.parallelize([("a", 2), ("a", 3)])
     |      >>> sorted(x.join(y).collect())
     |      [('a', (1, 2)), ('a', (1, 3))]
     |  
     |  keyBy(self, f)
     |      Creates tuples of the elements in this RDD by applying C{f}.
     |      
     |      >>> x = sc.parallelize(range(0,3)).keyBy(lambda x: x*x)
     |      >>> y = sc.parallelize(zip(range(0,5), range(0,5)))
     |      >>> [(x, list(map(list, y))) for x, y in sorted(x.cogroup(y).collect())]
     |      [(0, [[0], [0]]), (1, [[1], [1]]), (2, [[], [2]]), (3, [[], [3]]), (4, [[2], [4]])]
     |  
     |  keys(self)
     |      Return an RDD with the keys of each tuple.
     |      
     |      >>> m = sc.parallelize([(1, 2), (3, 4)]).keys()
     |      >>> m.collect()
     |      [1, 3]
     |  
     |  leftOuterJoin(self, other, numPartitions=None)
     |      Perform a left outer join of C{self} and C{other}.
     |      
     |      For each element (k, v) in C{self}, the resulting RDD will either
     |      contain all pairs (k, (v, w)) for w in C{other}, or the pair
     |      (k, (v, None)) if no elements in C{other} have key k.
     |      
     |      Hash-partitions the resulting RDD into the given number of partitions.
     |      
     |      >>> x = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 4)])
     |      >>> y = sc.parallelize([("a", 2)])
     |      >>> sorted(x.leftOuterJoin(y).collect())
     |      [('a', (1, 2)), ('b', (4, None))]
     |  
     |  localCheckpoint(self)
     |      Mark this RDD for local checkpointing using Spark's existing caching layer.
     |      
     |      This method is for users who wish to truncate RDD lineages while skipping the expensive
     |      step of replicating the materialized data in a reliable distributed file system. This is
     |      useful for RDDs with long lineages that need to be truncated periodically (e.g. GraphX).
     |      
     |      Local checkpointing sacrifices fault-tolerance for performance. In particular, checkpointed
     |      data is written to ephemeral local storage in the executors instead of to a reliable,
     |      fault-tolerant storage. The effect is that if an executor fails during the computation,
     |      the checkpointed data may no longer be accessible, causing an irrecoverable job failure.
     |      
     |      This is NOT safe to use with dynamic allocation, which removes executors along
     |      with their cached blocks. If you must use both features, you are advised to set
     |      L{spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout} to a high value.
     |      
     |      The checkpoint directory set through L{SparkContext.setCheckpointDir()} is not used.
     |  
     |  lookup(self, key)
     |      Return the list of values in the RDD for key `key`. This operation
     |      is done efficiently if the RDD has a known partitioner by only
     |      searching the partition that the key maps to.
     |      
     |      >>> l = range(1000)
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize(zip(l, l), 10)

     |  toDebugString(self)
     |      A description of this RDD and its recursive dependencies for debugging.
     |  
     |  toLocalIterator(self)
     |      Return an iterator that contains all of the elements in this RDD.
     |      The iterator will consume as much memory as the largest partition in this RDD.
     |

     |  
     |  top(self, num, key=None)
     |      Get the top N elements from an RDD.
     |      
     |      .. note:: This method should only be used if the resulting array is expected
     |          to be small, as all the data is loaded into the driver's memory.
     |      
     |      .. note:: It returns the list sorted in descending order.
     |      
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([10, 4, 2, 12, 3]).top(1)
     |      [12]

     |  treeAggregate(self, zeroValue, seqOp, combOp, depth=2)
     |      Aggregates the elements of this RDD in a multi-level tree
     |      pattern.
     |      
     |      :param depth: suggested depth of the tree (default: 2)
     |      
     |      >>> add = lambda x, y: x + y
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 10)

     |      -5
     |  
     |  treeReduce(self, f, depth=2)
     |      Reduces the elements of this RDD in a multi-level tree pattern.
     |      
     |      :param depth: suggested depth of the tree (default: 2)
     |      
     |      >>> add = lambda x, y: x + y
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 10)

     |      -5
     |      >>> rdd.treeReduce(add, 1)
     |      -5
     |      >>> rdd.treeReduce(add, 2)

     |  
     |  union(self, other)
     |      Return the union of this RDD and another one.
     |      
     |      >>> rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 1, 2, 3])
     |      >>> rdd.union(rdd).collect()
     |      [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3]
     |  
     |  unpersist(self)
     |      Mark the RDD as non-persistent, and remove all blocks for it from
     |      memory and disk.
     |  
     |  values(self)
     |      Return an RDD with the values of each tuple.
     |      
     |      >>> m = sc.parallelize([(1, 2), (3, 4)]).values()
     |      >>> m.collect()
     |      [2, 4]
     |  
     |  variance(self)
     |      Compute the variance of this RDD's elements.
     |      
     |      >>> sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3]).variance()
     |      0.666...
     |  
     |  zip(self, other)
     |      Zips this RDD with another one, returning key-value pairs with the
     |      first element in each RDD second element in each RDD, etc. Assumes
     |      that the two RDDs have the same number of partitions and the same
     |      number of elements in each partition (e.g. one was made through
     |      a map on the other).
     |      
     |      >>> x = sc.parallelize(range(0,5))
     |      >>> y = sc.parallelize(range(1000, 1005))
     |      >>> x.zip(y).collect()
     |      [(0, 1000), (1, 1001), (2, 1002), (3, 1003), (4, 1004)]
     |  
     |  zipWithIndex(self)
     |      Zips this RDD with its element indices.
     |      
     |      The ordering is first based on the partition index and then the
     |      ordering of items within each partition. So the first item in
     |      the first partition gets index 0, and the last item in the last
     |      partition receives the largest index.
     |      
     |      This method needs to trigger a spark job when this RDD contains
     |      more than one partitions.
     |      
     |      >>> sc.parallelize(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 3).zipWithIndex().collect()
     |      [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2), ('d', 3)]
     |  
     |  zipWithUniqueId(self)
     |      Zips this RDD with generated unique Long ids.
     |      
     |      Items in the kth partition will get ids k, n+k, 2*n+k, ..., where
     |      n is the number of partitions. So there may exist gaps, but this
     |      method won't trigger a spark job, which is different from
     |      L{zipWithIndex}
     |      
     |      >>> sc.parallelize(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 3).zipWithUniqueId().collect()
     |      [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 4), ('d', 2), ('e', 5)]
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors inherited from RDD:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)
     |  
     |  context
     |      The L{SparkContext} that this RDD was created on.
    
    

We shall cover some of these methods and transformations in upcoming lessons and labs. As a quick example, Let's look at the `getNumPartitions()` function which resuts the total partitions of an RDD.

    getNumPartitions(self)
           Returns the number of partitions in RDD



```python
# Get the number of logical partitions for intRDD


# 4
```

### SUMMARY

In this lesson we went through a brief introduction to RDD creation from a Python collection, setting number of logical partitions for an RDD and extracting lineage and of an RDD in a spark application. We also looked at checking an RDD's id used by spark and setting names for RDDs as an indication of content. Following labs will build upon this knowledge and we shall see how transformations and actions can be applied to RDDs in a distributed setup.
